# Finding-Falcone

Our problem is set in the planet of Lengaburu. After the Recent Falicornian war, king shan has exiled Queen AI falcone for 15 years. However, if he finds her before the 15 years are up, she has to go into exile for another 15 years!

King shah has received intelligence that AI falcone is hiding in one of these six neighbouring planets:-

1) DonLon.
2) Enchai.
3) Jebing.
4) Sapir.
5) Lerbin.
6) Pingasor. However, he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these planets.

# Code Organization :-

Code is broken down into following steps :-

1) Select 4 planets to search (out of the total 6).
2) Select which space vehicles to send to these planets.
3) See how much time it will take for the vehicle to reach their targets.
4) Show final result of success or failure.

# solution :-
I build UI through which king shan can find AI falcone.
